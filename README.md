🦷 Dental AI Lead Routing System – Summary

We have built an automated lead management system designed specifically for dental clinics.

🔹 What It Does:

1️⃣ Instant Lead Detection
Whenever a new patient inquiry is added to the system (Google Sheet), the automation immediately processes it.

2️⃣ Emergency Case Identification
If the inquiry includes keywords such as:

Emergency

Root Canal

Severe Pain

Swelling

Broken Tooth

The system automatically flags it as urgent.

3️⃣ Smart Email Routing

🚨 Emergency cases → Sent directly to the doctor

📩 Normal inquiries → Sent to front desk / clinic owner

4️⃣ Duplicate Protection
Once a lead is processed, its status is automatically updated to prevent repeat notifications.

🔹 Business Impact

No emergency patient gets missed

Faster response time

Better patient conversion

Organized lead tracking

Zero manual checking of sheets

🔹 Result

Your clinic receives the right lead information, at the right time, without manual effort.
